This project pulls fake data about markets and accounts in Sonoma County from an SQL server for practice in displaying them in responsive drop down tables. I don't currently have the API running on any server so a screenshot of the app running has been included. This project was designed by Dr. Ali Kooshesh of Sonoma State University.
